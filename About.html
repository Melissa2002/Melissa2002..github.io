                <h2>About Me: Learning How to Learn</h2>
                <p></p>
                In 2016, I learned from my high school Spanish teacher that students who grew up playing an instrument were able to catch on to new languages faster.
                In 2020, I took chemistry as a general education requirement and was surprised to see equations I used in physics in the text book. 
                Last year, I asked a friend who is persuing a pHd in synthetic biology what made him so passionate about his field of study. He responded
              that evolution has created the most efficient models and systems which we can mimick the design of and apply to technology. 
               A few months ago, an interviewer told me the best skill you can offer for any job is knowing how to learn.
              Yesterday, I built my first fire with just a lighter and whatever I could find at the campsite after having Survivor in the background while I was studying for finals.
              
              It took me 20 years and then some to realize that wisdom doesn't come from understanding concepts, but from the ability to apply those concepts into completely 
              new problems. My biggest goal is to take on experiences that change the way I walk through everyday life. While unconventional for a professional website, I have included 
              projects aside from those related to bioinformatics, data analysis, computer science, etc. Take a minute to look though them if you have the time!
