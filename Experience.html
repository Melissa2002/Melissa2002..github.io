           <h3>Cloud Developer Intern @Codex Health</h3>
            <p>
             - Designed, developed, and implemented 3 REST APIs which provided clinicians with real-time patient data.
              - Performed +5 code refactors and a data migration in Go in order to adapt to previous team developments.
              - Completed Asana tasks regarding audit logging, API specs, API implementations, debugging, and synthetic tests within an hour of when the request was created.
            </p>

           <h3>AVID Tutor @Escondido High School</h3>
            <p>
              - Provided educational support to up to 7 high school students at a time in subjects including AP Physics, AP Calculus, AP Computer Science, and AP Biology 9hrs/week.
              - Prepared underrepresented students for in-class and AP tests by walking through practice questions, brainstorming new problem solving methods, and organizing group work.
              </p>
      
          <h3>Undergraduate Reasearch Assistant @UCSD Medical School</h3>
            <p>
              - Developed Python code aimed at determining similarities between different days of a patient’s raw continuous glucose monitoring data using correlation matrices, dendograms, principal component analysis, and k-means.
              - Learned the fundamentals of implementing REST APIs and inspecting websites in order to create an algorithm that improves efficiency in retrieving data on specific selected gene variants in Python.
              - Peer edited an article detailing the accuracy of self-reported patient data for Type 1 Diabetes by researching information about similar devices and determining the potential impact on the diabetic community.
            </p>
           <h3>Continuous Glucose Monitoring Fingerprinting Project</h3>
            <p>
              - Programmed an algorithm to prepare and plot +40,000 blood glucose data points from 57 subjects.
              - Used Principal Component Analysis plots to determine if a subject’s CGM trace is uniquely identifiable.
              - Applied and modified a GitHub package which included over twenty different functions used to interpret constant glucose monitoring trace.
