              <p>
                As an undergraduate research assistant I mainly worked on methods of analyzing continuous glucose monitoring trace: specifically, determining if an individual's glucose trace 
                was uniquely identifiable to them. I developed python code aimed at determining similarities between different days of a patient's raw continuous glucose monitoring data using 
                correlation matrices, dendograms, principal component analysis, and k-means.<br>

            <h3>Medical Imaging Data Engineering Intern @Surgalign: 01/2023-07/2023</h3>
              <p>
              For this project, I created a code in Python that could parse out values from a csv file in order to the organize subsets based on manufacturer and model of the machine (see presentation below). The internship continued into my spring quarter of junior year
              where I then expanded to create an interactive web app that could combine datasets from the company database and compare various metrics, but
              I am unable to share findings for this portion as it disclosed patient information. <br>
