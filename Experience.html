              <p>
                As an undergraduate research assistant I mainly worked on methods of analyzing continuous glucose monitoring trace: specifically, determining if an individual's glucose trace 
                was uniquely identifiable to them. I developed python code aimed at determining similarities between different days of a patient's raw continuous glucose monitoring data using 
                correlation matrices, dendograms, principal component analysis, and k-means.<br>

              <p>
              For this project, I created a code in Python that could parse out values from a csv file in order to the organize subsets based on manufacturer and model of the machine (see presentation 
              below). The internship continued into my spring quarter of junior year where I then expanded to create an interactive web app that could combine datasets from the company database 
              and compare various metrics, but cannot disclose findings. <br>

              <p>
                During my internship I designed, developed, and implemented 3 REST APIs which provided clinicians with real-time patient data using Golang. 
                Because I was building off previously developed source code, I performed +5 code refactors and a data migration in order to meet the needs of
                the design. I also completed miscelaneous tasks including audit logging, debugging, and synthetic tests.

              <p>
                As an AVID tutor, I provided  educational support to up to 7 high school students at a time in subjects including AP Physics, AP Calculus, AP Computer Science, and AP Biology 9hrs/week.
                This included walking through practice questions, brainstorming new problem solving methods, and organizing group work.
