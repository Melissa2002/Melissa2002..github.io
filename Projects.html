                <h2>Low on time and want a quick overview? Here is my resume: </h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Melissa and I am a Junior studying Bioinformatics at the University of California, San Diego. 
                From violin to hiking national parks to painting to joinging a business fraternity to spending the weekends dabbling making a website, I believe one of my 
                greatest strengths is my ablity to balance my versitle interests. Much like my lifestyle, bioengineering has the reputation for "Jack of all trades, 
                master of none", but in an era where technology changes overnight, I would argue that the second part of the quote ("but often times better than a 
                master of one") holds true! With an interdisciplinary study, I challenge myself to think harder and quicker everyday. While others may know more than
                 me going into a project, I can garuntee that I will finish it learning the most!</p>
               <p> I created this website so you can learn more about my background, experience and interests. I am excited for you to get to know me and if you
  would like me to get to know you, feel free to head to my contact page and shoot me a message on the platform of your choice.</p>
              <h2> Fingerprinting Project as an Undergraduate Researcher at UCSD's Medical School</h2>
                <p>I dedicated the summer of 2022 to research at the Majithia Lab which specializes in the Endocrinology system. Continuous glucose monitoring provides real time measurements of glucose levels
              for diabeteic patients in order to determine preventative care before spikes. My project was centered around determining whether or not
              indivdual patients had glucose traces unique to them. Ideally, after determinging values for various features on the glucose traces per day I would
              have applied machine learning techniques, however I was limited by the dataset. While some individuals had trends in their days, others had a significant amount of 
              variation. To reach a more reliable conclusion, I believe I would need access to a dataset where patients had at least a month's worth of trace. </p>
