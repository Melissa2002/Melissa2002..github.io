              <h2>Data Quality Control for MRI files</h2>
                <p>MRI scans can help visualize what is going on inside someone's body, but all machines have some level of error. The goal of this project is to 
              access the quality of scans based on various tags within a dicom file. Each manufacturer has it's own ranges of values which decide whether or not an
              scan is acceptable, so I had to determine the best way to organize a series of scans and then find ranges for each numeric tag section available.</p>
               <h2>Exploring Machine Learning on MRI files</h2>
                <p>The goal of this project was to determine if RandomForestClassifier could determine wheter or not the scan was of a specific part of the body. This required creating
              a method to label non-numeric data, separating a testing and training set, and testing accuracy of the model. Additionally, I applied a 3d plot to analyze if
              altering parameters resulting in higher accuracy.</p>
              <h2>STEM Tutor at Escondido High </h2>
                <p>I took on this role to reach out to the community. 11 hours a week, I tutor a group of highschoolers which either do not have parents who went to college
              or have a various other obstacles which challege their education. My goal is to inspire and help kids who are behind in subjects. </p>
              <h2> Fingerprinting Project as an Undergraduate Researcher at UCSD's Medical School</h2>
                <p>I dedicated the summer of 2022 to research at the Majithia Lab which specializes in the Endocrinology system. Continuous glucose monitoring provides real time measurements of glucose levels
              for diabeteic patients in order to determine preventative care before spikes. My project was centered around determining whether or not
              indivdual patients had glucose traces unique to them. Ideally, after determinging values for various features on the glucose traces per day I would
              have applied machine learning techniques, however I was limited by the dataset. While some individuals had trends in their days, others had a significant amount of 
              variation. To reach a more reliable conclusion, I believe I would need access to a dataset where patients had at least a month's worth of trace. </p>
